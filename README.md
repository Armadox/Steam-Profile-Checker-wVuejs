Backend is basically a single JS file that I use as a proxy to dodge CORS

I added the file called "proxy.js" to my repository, if you want and replicate it for yourself.

You can get a SteamUserAPI Key from here: [LINK](https://steamcommunity.com/dev?l=german)

Don't forget to insert your API key from steam into the JS file.
