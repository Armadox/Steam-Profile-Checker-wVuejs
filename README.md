Backend is basically a single JS file that I use as a proxy to dodge CORS

I am hosting it for free on here: [Render](https://render.com)

I added the file called "proxy.js" to my repository, if you want and replicate it for yourself.

You can get a SteamUserAPI Key from here: [LINK](https://steamcommunity.com/dev?l=german)

Don't forget to insert your API key from steam into the proxy.js file.
